# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Overview

This project is a complete sales analysis of a pizza restaurant using SQL and Tableau. The primary goal was to extract insights from raw transactional data and build a visually intuitive dashboard to help stakeholders understand business performance. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total orders, pizza category sales, busiest days/times, and top-selling pizzas were identified and visualized.

* Handled inconsistencies in column naming, pizza size categories, and order IDs.
